# Card Reward Calculator

A simple and smart web app that tells you **which credit card gives you the highest reward** for your current purchase.

Enter the purchase amount and choose the category (like dining, fuel, shopping etc.), and the app instantly recommends the best card **you own** along with how many points you’ll earn and the approximate value of those points.

No logins. No tracking. No cloud.
Your card data stays **only in your browser**.

### ✨ Features

- Instantly compare rewards for all your cards
- See the points *and* value you’ll get for every transaction
- Add, edit, or remove your own cards and categories
- Export / import your card data as CSV or JSON
- Works completely offline after first load
- 100% **free** and **open-source**

### 🎯 Who should use this?

Anyone with multiple credit cards in India who wants to **maximize reward points** on every spend without memorizing which card is best for which category.
